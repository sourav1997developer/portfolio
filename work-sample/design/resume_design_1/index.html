            <p><span class="text1">Ideally, the length of your resume should not exceed not one page</span>. However, if you have more than 10 years' experience, you can extend it to 2 pages. A good resume is always concise and to the point. The formatting should be simple, consistent and clear</p>
           
            <li class="formate">Well-crafted sections</li>
            <p>For  easy readability, divide your resume into multiple sections. It allows the readers to easily get the information, as required. The sections can be, but not limited to, as described below.
              <ol type="a">
                <li style="font-size: 23px;">Contact information</li>
                <li style="font-size: 23px;">Experience (Work Experience, projects and Internships)</li>
                <li style="font-size: 23px;">Education</li>
                <li style="font-size: 23px;">Skills</li>
                <li style="font-size: 23px;">Awards and Recognition</li>
              </ol>
            </p>

            <li class="formate">Actions verbs</li>
            <p><span class="text1">Actions verbs allow your words to have a long-lasting impression</span>. Actions verbs shorten sentences, bring out clarity and can summaries a point in an impactful way.</p>

            <li class="formate">Quantify to make an impact</li>
            <p>Numbers add specificity and strength to your resume demonstrate the impact to you made in your previous roles. An easy way to do  this is to add metrics to your experience or achievements, wherever applicable.</p>

            <li class="formate">Spotlight Your Skills</li>
            <p><span span class="text1">Finally, your resume must highlight the skills you possess and how they match the job requirement</span>. If you are student looking for an internship or a fresher, you can highlight the transferable skills that you can bring for a particular job role.</p>

            <li class="formate">Tailor Your Resume</li>
            <p>The golden rule here is to follow horses for courses. It means not peddling the same resume for different roles. Spend time in  understanding the skills required for the role (look at the JD carefully) and craft a different resume for different requirements.</p><br>
